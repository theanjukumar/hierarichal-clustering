# hierarichal-clustering
Hierarchical clustering is a method of cluster analysis in data mining that creates a hierarchical representation of the clusters in a dataset. The method starts by treating each data point as a separate cluster and then iteratively combines the closest clusters until a stopping criterion is reached

# PROJECT TITLE
Analysis and prediction of "mall_customers.csv" of American mall market called as Phonix Mall,to findout requirements of dendrogram using seipy library with the help of "seipy.cluster.hirearchy ,to ace the no of linkage of the clustering to predict

# PROBLEM STATEMENT
The american finance clients as per the rate of "GDP OF 2011" found highest number of growth in bussiness market. As a data science engineer,Find out wihch hierarchic cluster gives maximum linkage in upcoming future
# TASKS
TASK 1:import the libraries and dataset
TASK 2: using the dendogram to find the optimal number of cluster
TASK 3: create a hierarchical model and visualize the cluster with the help of matplotlibrary

# CONCLUSION
According to the model, as a engineer my prediction is cluster3 has highest number of linkage
